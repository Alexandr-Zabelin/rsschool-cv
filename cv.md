3. I am a student in Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty at [SPBU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_State_University) with major in Software Engineering. I like figuring out how things work, learning something new and improve myself everyday. That is one of the reasons why I enrolled in software engineering. Besides, I love watching visual outcomes of my work, when I am able to see the result of what I have been working so hard for. So, taking into account all things written above, it is getting clear, why I am passionate about Front-end development.
